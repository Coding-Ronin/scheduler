# Github Mistakes
Due to a rushed schedule the organization and commits for this github have been warped to display incorrect values.
The "master" branch is the real application used for deployment.
We incorrectly used github to store our prototypes which caused commits to not appear in the master project.

Because of this mistake. The branch "tempus-deployment" will be used as it represents the amount of work both project members committed.
However, please know that the branch "master" is the actual branch used for deployment.
